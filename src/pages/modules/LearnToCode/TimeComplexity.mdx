# Time Complexity

Prerequisites: Nothing

Note: If you have never coded before, you may want to skip this until you have done a few simple problems.

Here are some additional resources if you would like: 

<ResourceList moduleName={moduleName} topicId={topicId}/>

Time Complexity is all about determining the worst-case scenario for the time it takes for code to run. 
This matters because probelms have a time limit for your code to run for each test-case which is usually a couple seconds.
With good constant factors, this you are limited to around $5 * 10^8$ opperations for a problem. 

# Big O Notation

The way we measure a code's time complexity is in Big O Notation. 

`$\mathcal{O}(f(x))$` is how many opperations the worst-case-scenario of f(x) takes to complete. 

Here are some example time complexities: 


The code below runs in `$\mathcal{O}(1)$`since it does a constant number of opperations:

```cpp
int a = 5;
int b = 7;
int c = a + b; 
```

To keep it simple, we say that `$\mathcal{O}(C)$` = `$\mathcal{O}(1)$`
as the extact number will not often affect the run-time. 

The code below runs in `$\mathcal{O}(n)$` since it does a constant number of opperations $n$ times: 

```cpp
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
	int a = 5; 
    int b = 7; 
    c = a + b; 
}
```

Once again, we ignore $C$ so `$\mathcal{O}(n)$` becomes `$\mathcal{O}(n)$`.

If we add one more loop, it will run in `$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$`.

```cpp
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
        int a = 5; 
        int b = 7; 
        c = a + b; 
    }
}
```

Here is table to refernce if you are just starting out:

| $n$                  | Possible complexities                                                  |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------       |
| $n \le 10$           | `$\mathcal{O}(n!)$`, `$\mathcal{O}(n^7)$`, `$\mathcal{O}(n^6)$`        |
| $n \le 20$           | `$\mathcal{O}(2^n \cdot n)$`, `$\mathcal{O}(n^5)$`                     |
| $n \le 100$          | `$\mathcal{O}(n^4)$`                                                   |
| $n \le 500$          | `$\mathcal{O}(n^3)$`                                                   |
| $n \le 7500$         | `$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$`                                                   |
| $n \le 7 \cdot 10^4$ | `$\mathcal{O}(n \sqrt n)$`                                             |
| $n \le 5 \cdot 10^5$ | `$\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$`                                              |
| $n \le 5 \cdot 10^6$ | `$\mathcal{O}(n)$`                                                     |
| $n \le 10^{18}$      | `$\mathcal{O}(\log^2 n)$`, `$\mathcal{O}(\log n)$`, `$\mathcal{O}(1)$` | 

For now, just worry about a few cases: 

If $n \le 500$,  `$\mathcal{O}(n^3)$` works

If $n \le 8000$,  `$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$` works

If $n \le 5 \cdot 10^6$,  `$\mathcal{O}(n)$` works
