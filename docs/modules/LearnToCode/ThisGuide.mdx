# This Guide 

Prerequisites: Nothing

Whether you are new to programming or someone who wants to push their abilties to the next level, 
this guide will help you to realize your potential. While the emphasis in on competitive programming,
the content taught here will enhance your problem-solving abilities, teach you how to break down abstract 
concepts, and allow you to code naturally. 

# Competitive Programming

Competitive programming in a nut-shell is a competition you aim to solve a certain number of problems in a
certain amount of time. The main catch is, that unlike almost everything else, the answers to these problems
are not specific words or numbers, rather they are generic algorithms. If this is your first exposure, then this
may sound overwhelming, but fret not: once you actually get into programming, this will be better understood.


The ultimate reason for this guide is to help you dominate competitive programming problems. Competitions 
are hosted locally, but the main target of this guide are the olympiads, specifically for the U.S., USACO. 
You may learn more about these contests now, but I recommend waiting since all of these problems will 
seem quite scary and overwhelming if you do not know how to code. Additionally, worrying about potential 
progression and the details of the contests is NOT more import than learning how to compete in them. You can
NOT "fake it to you make it" in these contests. 

# Lanuage

If you are unware, there are many programming languages. This guide is made exclusively for C++. This is the 
best language for competitive programming, and it is better to learn than python since you must be more explicit
with what you code, thereby understanding it better. 

# Environment

To code, you have to have certain software. I recommend VSCODE which I will link below, but you may use whatever
you prefer.

# Last

It is import to note that you do NOT have to be a genius to excel at programming. You don't have to have a
strong math background. Don't get discouraged if you are confused at first as jumping from not understanding
programming to solving problems on your own is a BIG leap. 

Also, you are able to track your progress with problems and topics. If you are confused about a topic or problem, 
you can always skip it and come back to it later.
